Great, a dashboard for an online clothing shop can be a useful tool for monitoring key metrics such
as sales, website traffic, and customer engagement. Here are some specific elements you may want to
consider including in your dashboard:

1.Sales data: display information on total sales, sales by category, and sales by date range.

2 Website traffic: show metrics such as the number of visitors, page views, and bounce rate.

3 Customer engagement: display data on customer reviews, ratings, and social media engagement.

4 Inventory management: Show the stock levels, the best-selling products, the products with low
stock and the products that are out of stock.

5 Marketing performance: monitor the performance of marketing campaigns, such as email campaigns,
social media ads, and Google Ads.

6 Return and refund: Show the number of returns and refunds, the reasons for the returns and
refunds, and the products that are mostly returned.

7 Mobile optimization: Monitor the percentage of customers accessing the website from mobile
devices, and the percentage of mobile customers that are converting.

8 User-interface: Show the most visited pages, the most searched products, and the products that are
added to the cart but not purchased.

All these points can be shown in tables, charts, and graphs to make it easy to understand and
compare data over time. Additionally, you can add filters and drill-down options to allow users to
view data at different levels of granularity.

between different data views. Additionally, consider adding filters and drill-down options to allow
users to view data at different levels of granularity.
